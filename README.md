# athinia.com
This is the private repo for the athinia.com Next.js and Tailwind CSS website.

* Replace all stylesheets with TailwindCSS classes

* use NextJS as static side generator, no server-side code required

* Create components for reusable parts of the page (e.g. buttons, dialogs, FAQ boxes, etc.)

* Optimize for performance by limiting 3rd party JavaScript libraries (e.g., no jQuery, stick to react where possible)

* Chrome Lighthouse (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) ratings for performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO must be 95+

* As responsive and mobile friendly as the current design

* Code shared on a private Github repo, with at least bi-weekly updates and status reports (we can clone and run the code ourselves so no need to host a development environment)
